# Description of the Project
Using Processing, our team created visuals for our chosen audio Axel F by Crazy Frog. Aleena had to have 2 visuals as the music repeated and also so we all had a similar limit of time to work on. Her visual shows a swirl. Ciaras visual shows rainbow scribbles moving around.Amys visual shows a rose like flower shape and then exposes another abstract shape inside it. It expands to the beat.Roxanas visual is of a frog image that bounces up and down the screen bouncing off the wall and every time it lands on the ground it squishes. There is a rainow aura around the frog and also rainbow grass at the bottom of the screen hip hop .

# How it works
- Roxana 
RoxanaVisual1.java works by firstly declaring the package in this instance C21374751 student number,after import statements and class declaration it declares the fields such as ourvisual ov, images and floats variables which will be used in RoxanaVisual1 . Then I constructed the body for the frog image and grass such as positioning and moveent like the frog hopping then with render i set the background colours to fade, and make it so the frog bounces back when it reaches the walls and changes directions and change and crates the raimbow aura around the frog image by altering an ellipse , also im render i coded the squish effect and the grass to alter in height
# What I am most proud of in the assignment
- ROXANA
- I chose the song for this and im half proud of myself and half hate myself for choosing such an upbeat, classic and fun yet such an annoying somewhat repetitive song,
- I also notes the time stamps for the code which we then changed it to just have a switch case but its the thought that counts
- I am also proud of how I got the frog to squish whever it landed while hopping, I found it quite hard to do and it did have issues with it like it would stay squished the whole time or not be there at all. To fix this i had to fix the statement so that the size changed on the frogs vertical posotion.

- CIARA
- I'm most proud of how this project showcases our creative individuality. I like how different and unique each of our visuals are from each other and I think it suits the music that we've chosen. The aspect I love the most about my part is the fast movement of the shapes and lines. It goes well with the upbeat song in the background.
- Time stamps : 0-27s Amy, 28-42s Aleena, 43-1.10s Roxana, 1.11-1.24s Aleena, 1.24-1.50s Ciara

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
